			<h2>Teaching the Camp Song</h2>
	
			<p>Start with something they know, that was the advice.  
				So &quot;You Are My Sunshine&quot; was practiced after setting the table and was sung for 
				the parents after we cheered them on in their entrance to the dining hall.  Fortunately for Joe, Fawn, 
				Ansley, and I, we had some strong singers in the bunch and, in particular, siblings who had already been
				to camp twice! They knew everything, of course, but we put on a good show of knowing what we were doing, 
				even if it wasn&#39;t always musical! &nbsp;  
			</p>
			<p>Since Joe is a great drummer, we tried to add some rhythm to our camp
				song, &quot;Arms&quot; which Ansley played on the guitar.  Since we had <em>lots</em> of time on Wednesday and
				Thursday, we attempted a shorter, rhythmic version of &quot;You Are So Beautiful&quot; which Nancy likes so much 
				in her end-of-week video production. We hoped they would deliver a sweet rendition to their parents when we 
				returned them after the parents&#39; special dinner. The lyrics are simple enough, but there was only so much 
				of that beautiful melody line to be compromised for easier singing!  Joe and I finally went back to teaching 
				the camp song which, surprisingly, seemed much easier for the children after this other attempt, go figure. 
			</p>
			<p>The children delivered a tear-jerking performance of the camp song Thursday to start off the &quot;Talent&quot; 
			show and again before the Parent Coronation on Saturday. There were sweet smiles, hands on hearts, and loving looks
			all around.  Good memories for these hard-working parents to take home with them for getting through the next challenges!

			<h3>Lyrics for the Camp Song</h3>
			<h4>from &quot;Arms&quot; <br /> by Christina Perry</h4>
	
			<p>I never thought that you would be the one to hold my heart, <br />
				But you came around and you knocked me off the ground from the start. <br />&nbsp;<br />
				I hope you can see right through my walls.<br/> I hope you can catch me, &#39;cause I&#39;m already falling.<br />&nbsp;<br />
				I&#39;ll never let your love get so close; <br />
				You put your arms around me and I&#39;m home.<br />&nbsp;<br />
				How many times will I change my mind and turn around? <br />
				I can&#39;t decide if I&#39;ll let you save my life or if I&#39;ll drown. <br />&nbsp;<br />
				You put your arms around me and I believe that it&#39;s easier to let me go;<br />
				but when you put your arms around me, I&#39;m home. <br />&nbsp;<br />
				The world is coming down on me and I can&#39;t find a reason to be loved.<br />
				I never wanna leave but I can&#39;t seem to make it on my own.<br />&nbsp;<br />
				I hope that you see right through my walls. <br />
				I hope that you catch me, &#39;cause I&#39;m already falling.<br />
				I hope I can let your love get closer.<br />&nbsp;<br />
				You put your arms around me and I&#39;m home.
