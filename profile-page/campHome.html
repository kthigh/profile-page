			<h2>Purpose of Healing Hearts Camp</h2>
			<p>Healing Hearts Camps were designed by Nancy Thomas to provide an opportunity for families who have
			challenging children to get support from camp staff while learning and applying new parenting techniques.
			Parents are given tools to put themselves back in charge of their family. They learn about the overwhelming drive
			for a sense of safety that drives many challenging behaviors.  The tools they learn and practice quickly give their
			children assurance that they have a parent that they can trust to keep them safe.<br />&nbsp;<br />
			</p>
		
			<h2>Staff - The <em>Flight Check Crew</em> </h2>
			<p><img class="right_img" src="images/camp_shirt.jpg" alt="Our Staff T-shirts" title="Our Camp Shirts">
			The Flight Check Crew is integral to the design of a Healing Hearts Camp.
			We all got to wear these cool shirts which identified us clearly to parents and children
			as being trained in using the tools they would be taking back home with them.
			 Our staff included camp veterans and first-timers, young and seasoned, therapists and Moms. 
			 All of us worked tirelessly, trying to catch up on sleep, 
			and pitching in with whatever Nancy, Melissa, and Scott needed us to do.

				<h2>Families</h2>
				<p>Twelve families joined us for this camp. Several of these families included adopted children who
				had already been through a variety of programs and were still needing help so their behaviors would not
				be tearing their adoptive family apart. <br />&nbsp;<br />One family brought their adoptive son from overseas and 
				another had packed up their west coast home, come to IL camp, and left afterwards for their new home in Hawaii.
				All of these families were ready for change and left camp with more loving, respectful, and safe children.

			<h3>My Experience with Attachment Therapy</h3>
			<p> I met Nancy Thomas for the first time when I was working with an Awesome Mom and her adopted son as a family-based
			therapist.  They had reserved space at the Tennessee Healing Hearts Camp and I was encouraged to come with them for free
			as a staff member.  Little did I know then that this would be the hardest working trip ever! <br />&nbsp;<br /> Nancy trains the staff on 
			Friday and Saturday, and opens the training up to the community.  We received some of the training that the parents get
			during the week. The staff also learned and practiced Crisis Prevention techniques and role-played the Flight Check Crew duties.<br />&nbsp;<br />
			I was able to complete further training for helping Challenging Children when I flew out to Colorado Springs the following
			year.  That's where I met Melissa.  Scott had also been at the Tennessee camp, so we all trained together with Nancy, and
			I quickly said Yes to the invitation from Melissa and Scott to work at their Illinois camp.
