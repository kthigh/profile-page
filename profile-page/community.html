<h3>Carnegie Free Library of Beaver Falls, Committee Member</h3>
<p>
	As a member of two Pillar committees, I join with CFLBF in implementing the <em>Comprehensive Plan for Vision Transformation</em>. This library is being transformed into a "21st Century Library" and lives daily by its motto "Honor the past . . . Live in the present . . . and Innovate the Future".

<h3>AcceleratePa/GoNetspeed Intern</h3>

<p id="pTwo">
	Through volunteering on the Technology/Programming Committee for the library, I was introduced to this initiative to bring a new high-speed internet provider to Beaver County.  My work as an intern has included promoting meetings which educate county residents on this opportunity to save money by "cutting the cord" and using their internet to watch movies, sports, and their favorite weekly broadcasts.
