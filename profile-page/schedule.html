			<p> Nancy Thomas has been running Healing Hearts Camp for many years so this schedule has been revised often.
			For the parents, the goal is to optimize training time and application of new parenting skills.  For children,
			the goal is to have them want to spend time with their parents rather than the Flight Check Crew who are all
			about structure and waiting patiently as long as needed for compliance. When they are able to respectfully
			be with their parents, they receive nurture in the form of soft eyes, soft voices, and lots of hugs.<br />&nbsp;<br />
			The Flight Check Crew began on Sunday before dinner teaching the children basic respect and manners. Tables were
			set for their family according to a diagram the butler on Downton Abbey would have approved! Parents were instructed
			during that time to have &quot;Eagle Eyes&quot; and note any elbows on tables, feet on chairs, interruptions, or eating
			with mouths open. Once spotted, they raised their hands, called &quot;Flight Check&quot; and were rewarded with 
			chocolates and a stick-on jewel for their name-tag as their child was escorted to the Crew table on the far end of the dining hall to
			finish their meal. <br />&nbsp;<br />Parents were also instructed prior to dinner to fill out a card indicating what
			infraction they had observed.  This assisted the Flight Check Crew in having the children process their removal by
			answering the question &quot;So what happened?&quot; truthfully.  Resistant children were kept with the Flight Check Crew 
			as long as needed, even through the night if necessary, to process.  This was when they showed us their best lies, tantrums, accusations,
			and pity-parties, while their parents enjoyed the beautiful camp facilities and conversation with other adults.  Some 
			parents had their first restful sleep in months!  The Crew modeled respectful interactions and were trained to resist
			showing emotions, remaining patient and calm, and trading out with each other as this was tested. Once a child had
			processed what happened, they came up with their own restitution, frequently offering hand or back massages, given lovingly,
			to their parents.  Even by Tuesday lunch, this awesome group of parents had children using manners through most of the meal!

			<h3>The Perfect First Chore</h3>
			<h4>Folding Wash Cloths</h4>
			<ol>
				<li>smooth out cloth</li>
				<li>connect bottom corners to top corners</li>
				<li>smooth out folded cloth</li>
				<li>check corners again</li>
				<li>connect right-side corners with left-side corners</li>
				<li>smooth and check corners for A&#43; work</li>
				<li>sit strong until parent is ready to check work</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Nancy Thomas teaches parents about how a child maintains a sense of 
			safety in their environment.  Adopted children in particular have a mental script that is highly self-critical.
			They avoid situations which will lead to failure, creating excuses, distractions, or battles to keep them safe and
			feeling in charge of themselves.<br />&nbsp;<br /> With this in mind, Nancy has the parents teach their children to
			perform simple chores like folding wash cloths and t-shirts, but with high expectations for &quot;A&#43;&quot; results.
			Chores are used to build patience and confidence.<br />&nbsp;<br />Another favorite chore Nancy tells parents about is
			sweeping the stairway using a hand broom. She tells them how her adopted daughter Beth set record times of 7 minutes and 
			18 hours, and is equally proud of both. <br />
			Nancy encourages parents to consider the long times for chore completion as freedom from needing to think of other 
			ways to keep a child occupied. Completion times decrease rapidly as children accept that their compliance will result
			in success, self-respect, and access to other activities.
